Ah, I understand. You need a JavaScript proxy code that can:

1. Proxy requests from Foxi Companion to (link unavailable)
2. Proxy responses from (link unavailable) to Foxi Companion

Here's a basic example of a JavaScript proxy function that can accomplish this:
```javascript
const proxy = (req, res) => {
// Forward request from Foxi Companion to (link unavailable)
if (req.method === 'GET') {
fetch((link unavailable) + req.url).then(res.send)
}

// Forward response from (link unavailable) to Foxi Companion
if ((link unavailable)) {
res.send((link unavailable))
}
}
```
This code uses the `fetch` API to forward requests from Foxi Companion to (link unavailable) and then sends the response back to Foxi Companion.

Please note that this is a simplified example and may need to be modified to fit your specific requirements. Additionally, you may need to handle errors, headers, and other aspects of the request and response.
